# Visual Effects Pro (Vite wrapper)

Minimal Vite + React wrapper around the `effects-pro/` library. The `effects-pro/` folder remains static and untouched; the wrapper is just for hosting a React UI or documentation shell if needed.

## Install

1. From this folder, install dependencies:
	- `npm install`

## Develop

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the URL printed in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

1. Create a production build: `npm run build`
2. Preview the build locally (optional): `npm run preview`

## Output

- Build artifacts are emitted to `dist/` (HTML, JS, and CSS generated by Vite).
- The `effects-pro/` folder is left unchanged and can be served or copied as-is alongside the built wrapper.
